# About CognitV Virtual Reality

Our project, undertaken by computer science students at Texas Christian University as part of our senior design program, spanned from September 2023 to April 2024. Collaborating with Dr. Nikki Fowler of CognitV Solutions, a startup focused on pioneering virtual reality experiences for mental health, we embarked on a journey to develop an innovative Virtual Reality exposure therapy solution for individuals grappling with social anxiety disorder (SAD). Under the guidance of our academic advisor, Dr. Bingyang Wei, we navigated through various challenges and technologies to create a transformative VR experience aimed at alleviating the burdens of SAD.

The primary objective of our senior design project was to create a Virtual Reality exposure therapy experience tailored to help individuals combat social anxiety disorder (SAD). We aimed to design a VR environment that offers a safe and controlled space for individuals with SAD to confront and navigate challenging social situations in a supportive setting.

The motivation behind our project stems from the prevalence of social anxiety disorder (SAD), affecting over 31% of adults in the U.S. Traditional treatment options for SAD often present barriers such as accessibility, cost, and a shortage of mental healthcare providers. In response, VR exposure therapy emerged as a promising solution due to its accessibility, convenience, and effectiveness in addressing SAD symptoms.

To realize our project goals, we leveraged various technologies. Unity served as our primary game development platform, allowing us to create immersive environments and incorporate assets from the Unity Asset Store, such as Mixamo characters. We utilized C# scripting to manage game progression, NPC interactions, and speech timing.

One of the key challenges we faced was seamlessly integrating AI within Unity to create dynamic NPC interactions. This required us to learn unfamiliar technologies like Unity and Convai without prior experience. Adapting to changing tech stacks and requirements added complexity to the project, as did debugging without access to VR headsets initially.

In terms of game progression, players immerse themselves in a professional setting, engaging in tasks like introducing themselves to NPCs, listening to speeches, and delivering presentations. Interactions with AI-driven NPCs provide dynamic conversational experiences, culminating in open-ended discussions about HR policies, reflecting real-world social scenarios.

# Download and Installation
Unfortunately, we had significant issues while building this game as a standalone app for the Quest, so the only way to play this game is via Quest Link to a PC.
1. Download the github repo zip and extract it to your desired location on your PC.
2. Download and install the Oculus/Meta PC app, then setup your headset. Instructions and download link here: https://www.meta.com/help/quest/articles/headsets-and-accessories/oculus-rift-s/install-app-for-link/
3. Connect your headset to your PC via Quest Link. It is recommended to use a quest cable for faster performance, but it is also possible to use Air Link. Instructions here: https://www.meta.com/help/quest/articles/headsets-and-accessories/oculus-link/set-up-link/
4. Run the exe file in the extracted zip, and it should run the game in your headset.
